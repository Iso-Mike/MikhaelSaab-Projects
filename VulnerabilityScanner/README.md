## Overview
The Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to identify common web application vulnerabilities, specifically SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This tool helps security professionals and developers to detect and mitigate these vulnerabilities, ensuring the security of web applications. It provides a terminal-based interface that is straightforward and efficient for performing basic security assessments on web applications.

## Features
- **SQL Injection Detection:** Scans web applications for SQL Injection vulnerabilities by sending crafted SQL payloads and analyzing the server's response for errors or unusual behavior.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection:** Identifies potential XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts into web forms and checking if they are reflected in the page content.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a simple, terminal-based interface for easy interaction and input, making the scanning process straightforward.
- **Exception Handling:** Implements robust error handling to manage network issues, incorrect inputs, and other potential disruptions during scanning.
- **Extensible Payloads:** Supports easy addition of new payloads for both SQL Injection and XSS detection, allowing for customization and extension of the scanner's capabilities.
